##### Scripting Language
- Series of commands that can executed line-by-line without compiler

- Programming Language for run time system that automatically reads and executes tasks

- [Interpreted](./interpreted_language.md) at run time

- [Primitives](./primitives.md) are usally basic tasks or [API](./api.md) calls, scripting language allows them to be combined into more programs

- When scripting an application, it is known as extension language

- Scripting languages also known as very [High Level Language](./high_level_language.md)

- Intended to be very fast to learn & write in(simple syntax)

- Converted into machine code on the fly by interpreter(Unlike [Compiled Languages](./compiled_language.md) which are converted into executable files before ran)

- Examples include: Javascript, Python, Typescript

- Easy to learn and fast to code in

- Lines have blurred over time of what should be considered a Scripting Language, generally agreed that is based off what language is used for

- Scripting language is not same as programming language
  - Programming language allows you to create "structure"
  - Scripting language allows you to give an already created application instructions

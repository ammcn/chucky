##### Machine Instructions
- [Machine Code](./machine_code.md) programs or commands.

- Machine instructions make up [machine language](./machine_language.md) program

- A single machine instruction is made up of several [bytes](./bytes.md) of memory
  - Which tells computer [CPU](./cpu.md) to perform one [machine operation](./machine_operation.md)
  - For each machine instruction system performs one machine operation

- CPU looks at machine instructions in the [systems main memory](./system_memory.md)

- Four main steps to machine instructions:
  - Fetch: the CPU fetches the instruction from memory. It stores [memory address](./memory_addresses.md) in the [program counter](./program_counter.md) and [instruction register](./instruction_register.md). Program counter points to next instruction at the end of current fetch

  - Decode: CPU interprets & decodes instruction as sequence of control signals to CPUs relevant functions 

  - Execute: CPUs relevant functions read signals which were previously decoded and complete actions which were instructed

  - Store: result is generated by operation, which is stored in main memory by CPU. Could be outputted to device

- Humans dont write in machine instruction, they typically write in [high level languages](./high_level_language.md)
